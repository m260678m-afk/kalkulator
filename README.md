### Project: Container Calculator (HTML/CSS/JS)

A simple front-end calculator that can be run locally using a Docker container with a lightweight Nginx server.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you must have **Docker** installed on your computer.

You can check if Docker is installed by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker --version

### Future

I will work on the project and try to add more functionalities.


### ver.1.0.3 

The code has been improved and a new theme change function has been added.
